   <h2>Basics</h2>
   Hello! This is a review of <b>9th Grade Physical Science</b> for Eastlake High School.
   This serves as a review of the final test at the end of the semester. It will cover
   Units 1-5 individually and, hopefully, concisely. This is also a reason for me to use
   HTML, so that's why this page is so ugly.

  <h3>Unit 1: Earth Science</h3>
  <p>

  <p>
   This is the Earth. It's what we're studying in this unit, and it also happens to be the
   planet we live on. In this unit, we studied:
   <ul>
    <li>Density</li>
    <li>Continental plates</li>
    <li>Constructive and Destructive Properties</li>
