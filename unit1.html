    This is the Earth. It's what we're studying in this unit, and it also happens to be the

    planet we live on. In this unit, we studied:

    <ul>

     <li>Density</li>

     <li>Continental plates</li>

     <li>Constructive and Destructive Properties</li>

    <ul>

   </p>


  <h2>Density</h2>
  <p>
   Density is mass/volume, or D=<sup>M</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub>. It states how much matter
   is packed into a certain amount of space. A good way to visualize this is the larger the
   density is in the same amount of space, essentially, the heavier the object. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Density plays a role in how high a liquid floats when stacked on top of one another. The
   lower the density, the higher it would float. This works with solids mixed with liquids 
   too. For example, water's density is exactly 1g/mL, corn syrup's density is 0.7g/mL, and 
   a piece of plastic is 0.8g/mL. Water would be on the bottom, corn syrup would be on top,
   and the plastic would fit neatly in the middle.
